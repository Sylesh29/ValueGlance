# Financial Data Filtering App

The **Financial Data Filtering App** is a user-friendly tool that helps analyze and filter financial data dynamically. Designed for investors, this app offers filtering, sorting, and responsive UI features to simplify the evaluation of financial performance metrics like revenue, net income, and EPS.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

As someone deeply passionate about **finance** and **technology**, I believe in making investing as approachable as learning a language. My vision aligns with **ValueGlance**, the "Duolingo of Investing," where simplicity meets impact. As a **Duolingo user for over 400+ days**, I understand the importance of consistency and design that engages users. Similarly, as a **long-term investor for 3+ years**, I’ve leveraged this experience to build a tool that bridges complex financial data and user-friendly technology.

## 🖥️ Features
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter data by date, revenue, and net income ranges.
- **Sorting Options:** Sort data by fields like date, revenue, and net income.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive across devices for seamless use.
- **Clean Aesthetic:** Inspired by **ValueGlance's design language**, offering a polished UI.
